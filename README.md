# Physics Simulations

An iOS app demonstrating physics simulations using Swift, SceneKit and UIKit. This project showcases various physics concepts through interactive 3D simulations.

## Features

### Sphere Physics Simulation
- **Gravity Simulation**: Three spheres with different masses falling under gravity
- **Collision Physics**: Objects interact with each other and the ground
- **Wind Force**: Toggle wind effect to see how objects react to external forces
- **Mass and Bounce Properties**: Each sphere has unique physical properties:
  - Red Sphere: Light (1.0 mass), High bounce (0.9)
  - Blue Sphere: Medium (2.0 mass), Medium bounce (0.7)
  - Green Sphere: Heavy (5.0 mass), Low bounce (0.3)

### Fluid Simulation
- **Particle-based Fluid**: 200 particles simulating fluid behavior
- **Realistic Water Properties**:
  - Zero-bounce particles for authentic liquid behavior
  - Optimized friction and damping for fluid-like movement
  - Particle collision and interaction
- **Real-time Physics**: Accurate gravity and collision detection
